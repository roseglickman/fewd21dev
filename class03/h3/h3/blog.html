					<h1>How I implemented Relaxer in two weeks and changed my Life.</h1>
					<img src="images/blog_photo1.jpg">
					<p>As hard as I tried I could never make sense of my life. One day after waking up at 5 p.m., yes I slept all day, I thought why don't I have other people make all my decision and do all my work for me. This way I can just laze my life away and do a lot of cool shit that other people don't have the priveledge to do while not appreciating that I have the change to do what other would like to do. Yes I know this was a run on sentence, I don't really give a shit. And yes I realize I could put fake text here. So, one day I woke up and realized why don't I just have other people make all my decisions for me thought Relaxr. This is what I made available to everyone. I am opening access today, so please implement Relaxr and over the next two weeks you will get to a point where you can be the one to change my life. Because who really changes there own life anymore.</p>

					<h1>I traveled across the globe thanks to Relaxr's Excel auomation.</h1>
					<img src="images/blog_photo2.jpg">
					<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood. And looked down one as far as I could. To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim. Because it was grassy and wanted wear,Though as for that the passing there. Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay. In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way. I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh. Somewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.</p>
