		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<section class="question">
			<span>+ What is the most common picture Relaxr customers take with their phone?</span>
			<p class="answer">Male nipples are most likely embryonic leftovers. All fetuses begin as females in the womb and, at 5.5 weeks, start developing certain female body parts such as nipples. When the Y chromosome shows up at the six week mark, the fetus produces testosterone and develops into a male, transforming body parts like nipples into mere decoration. Fun fact: Men are three times as likely than women to develop supernumerary nipples (1 in 18 men have them), extra bits located most often on a man's chest below his real nipples.</p>

		<section class="question">
			<span>+ Does anyone gossip about Relaxr?</span>
			<p class="answer">Teaching diction is a way to neutralize the language, meaning that Adele's accent goes from cockney British when she speaks to Standard American English when she sings. For singers without formal training, the disappearing accent comes down to vowels.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="question">
			<span>+ Has their ever been a lawsuit filled against Relaxr?</span>
			<p class="answer">The spins come from alcohols affect on the cupula, a jelly-like substance in the ear that controls spatial orientation. As alcohol-laden blood builds up in the cupula, it bends, sending signal after signal to the brain that your center of gravity is changing—that's when you feel dizzy.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="question">
			<span>+ How does Relaxr work?</span>
			<p class="answer">The brain (the cerebellum, to be exact) constantly predicts what will happen to your body and adjusts the movement of your muscles. For example, the cerebellum's synapses fire every time you take a step, activating the muscles in your legs a split second before your foot hits the ground (you can see the effect in this slow motion video of champion sprinter Usain Bolt).</p>
		</section>
		<section class="question">
			<span>+ How does Relaxr scam their customers?</span>
			<p class="answer">Very carefully. Life in space creates challenges that those of that us who live within earth's gravitational pull hardly give a second thought. Astronaut Scott Kelly summed it up well: With no gravity, two things are easier—carrying heavy items and fitting into small spaces. Everything else is more difficult.</p>
