			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p class="mission">Giving you the technology you need to work efficiently, so you have more free time. We want to help you get started on your bucket list! Because we travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape us.<p>
			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p class="story">Like many, we began as a start-up business. Our founder Luka Jalmari Draganov wanted to automate the print estimating and basic accounting process in her own business. She worked with a team of Newcastle University students to develop software to manage this more efficiently. Luka realised that other individuals and start up companies could also benefit from this and formed Relaxr in 1981 to begin selling the software.  As desktop PCs became widespread, so the Relaxr range grew and our business went from strength to strength.  We floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1989 and in 1999 we entered the FTSE 100 where we still remain.  We understand our customers needs and the challenges they face. Like them, Relaxr has innovation and entrepreneurial spirit at heart. Today we have millions of customers and circa 14,000 employees across 24 countries, including UK and Ireland, mainland Europe, North America, South Africa, Australia, Asia and Brazil. All helping individuals increase their work efficiency.</p>

			<p class="opinion">Epistemology is the study of the nature, source, limits, and validity of knowledge.  It is especially interested in developing criteria for evaluating claims people make that they know something.  In particular, it considers questions such as: What is knowledge?  What is the difference between knowledge and opinion or belief?</p>

			<p class="opinion">A rationalist epistemology claims that knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is possible only if it is based on self-evident and absolutely certain principles.  Such principles are not learned through experience; instead, they are implicit in the very notion of reasoning (in Latin: ratio) itself.</p>

			<p class="opinion">Plato is an example of a rationalist. He says that sense experience fails to provide us with any guarantee that what we experience is, in fact, true. The information we get by relying on sense experience is constantly changing and often unreliable.</p>
